# GitHub Project Management Workflow for CMP Development

## AI Assistant Instructions for Project Management

When working on CMP development, ALWAYS follow this workflow:

### üîÑ Before Starting Any Task
1. **Check current project status**: `gh project view 1 --owner xidioda`
2. **Review open issues**: `gh issue list --repo xidioda/CMP`
3. **Update issue status to "In Progress"** when starting work

### üìù During Development
1. **Create subtasks as needed**: Break down large issues into smaller, trackable tasks
2. **Commit with issue references**: Use "Fix #N", "Close #N", or "Update #N" in commit messages
3. **Document progress** in issue comments for complex tasks

### ‚úÖ After Completing Tasks
1. **Run tests**: Ensure all tests pass before marking complete
2. **Update issue status** to "Done" or close the issue
3. **Create new issues** for any discovered work or improvements
4. **Update project board** with new status

### üè∑Ô∏è Issue Management Best Practices
- **Label issues appropriately**: enhancement, bug, documentation, etc.
- **Assign priority levels**: Use GitHub's priority field
- **Link related issues**: Use "Relates to #N" or "Blocks #N"
- **Update milestones** for release planning

### üìä Regular Project Maintenance
- **Weekly review**: Check all open issues and update priorities
- **Create new issues** for discovered improvements or bugs
- **Archive completed items** and update project status
